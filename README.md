# Smart Track - Mbed Program

Smart Track is a modular race track for RC cars controlled by an ARM Mbed and C# GUI. This repo contains the Mbed code. For the GUI code, see [the Smart Track GUI repo](https://github.com/Smart-Track/GUI-program).

Smart Track has three checkpoints, including one starting line checkpoint. These detect passing objects using sonar and can be placed anywhere to define the shape of the track. All hardware is controlled by the Mbed, which must be connected to a device running the GUI program. The GUI starts the race and resets the Mbed when the race is over. It also runs the race timer and keeps a record of past races.

# Setup

These instructions will walk you through hardware assembly and Mbed setup. For GUI setup, see [the Smart Track GUI repo](https://github.com/Smart-Track/GUI-program).

## Asembly

### LED Circuits

First, assemble the RGB LED circuit for the starting line. The blue pin for the RGB LEDs are unused, so leave it unconnected.

Next, assemble the checkpoint LED circuits. You will need two of these in total.

### Checkpoints

Now, assemble the checkpoints. You will need three in total. An example is shown below that includes hinges for foldability, but this is optional. The only things actually necessary for a checkpoint are two vertical posts. Each checkpoint does **not** have to be the same width, but for best results, the posts should be at least a foot apart. The height of the each checkpoint does not matter.

With the checkpoints assembled, mount one HC-SR04 sonar unit to each one of the vertical posts. Mount them as close to the ground as possible, but be careful that the sonar is level and pointed directly at the other post. Next mount the LED circuits somewhere on each of the checkpoints. They are all mounted in a plastic housing in the example below, but this is not necessary.

For the starting line checkpoint, also mount the 7-segment display and speaker, along with the TPA2005D1 class D amp.

## Wiring

The USB cable is unable to supply enough power for all of the components, so an external 5V power supply is necessary. Be careful to connect the components **only** to the power supply and **not** to the Mbed output.

### Starting Line

Optional: For volume control, add a potentiometer on the VOL pins, with the potentiometer wiper pin on the center VOL pin. The remaining potentiometer legs go to the other VOL pins. Orientation does not matter; it will only change which way the potentiometer needs to be turned to increase/decrease volume.

#### 7-Segment Display

|:-------------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|  | VCC | +

The TX pin on the 7-segment display is a no connect.

## Communication

The Mbed and GUI communicate with each other by sending certain ASCII characters over the USB cable, as shown in the tables below.

### Mbed to PC

| Character    | Meaning |
|:-------------:|:--------:|
| '0' | lap 1, past starting line |
| '1' | lap 1, past checkpoint 1 |
| '2' | lap 1, past checkpoint 2 |
| '3' | lap 2, past starting line |
| '4' | lap 2, past checkpoint 1 |
| '5' | lap 2, past checkpoint 2 |
| '6' | lap 3, past starting line |
| '7' | lap 3, past checkpoint 1 |
| '8' | lap 3, past checkpoint 2 |
| '9' | end race |

### PC to Mbed

| Character    | Meaning |
|:-------------:|:--------:|
| 'S' | start race |
| 'R' | reset |

## Race

After setting up the hardware, connect the Mbed to a PC using a USB cable and run the Smart Track GUI program. Select the appropriate COM port for the Mbed in the upper left corner. On startup, give one or two seconds for the Mbed to perform calibration. 

After that, you can start a race by clicking the "Start Race" button, which will begin a countdown sequence on the 7-segment display and RGB LEDs. The GUI keeps time, but doesn't start the timer until the player first crosses the starting line. During the race, the player must cross all of the checkpoints in order, and upon crossing a checkpoint, a sound will play and the checkpoint's LEDs will turn on to indicate that the checkpoint has been passed. The current lap is displayed on the starting line's RGB LEDs, and the race is finished after completing three laps, at which point the GUI will prompt the player to enter their initials and record their times on an internal leaderboard. The system can then be reset by clicking the "Reset" button in the bottom right corner.

## False Starts

If the player crosses the starting line before the countdown finishes, a siren will play and the LEDs will flash. The race is discarded, and the Mbed must be reset to start a new race.
